# Ltc_AdvancedTemplateHints

Ltc_AdvancedTemplateHints is a module for Magento 2 that extends the default "Template Hints" feature. 

It is largely based on the work of [fbrnc](https://github.com/fbrnc) and his [Aoe_TemplateHints](https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_TemplateHints) module for Magento 1

This is my very first attempt at a real Magento 2 module so it can surely be improved

To display the template hints add `?ath=1` at the end of the URL and make sure the request IP is allowed in `dev/restrict/allow_ips` (Store > Configuration > Advanced> Developer > Developer Client Restriction > Allowed IPs)
